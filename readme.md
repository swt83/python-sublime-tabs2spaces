# Tabs2Spaces for Sublime Text Editor

I've recently decided I want my editor to translate all tabs into spaces.  It makes for cleaner code, especially when you're moving code onto Github.  I found this code online that will **auto-convert any file when it's saved**.  All code credit goes to [mbutler](http://www.butlerpc.net/blog/2012/07/sublime-text-2-plugin-to-convert-tabs-to-spaces-on-save/), thanks man.

## Install

* Open up terminal.
* Move to packges folder: ``cd /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages``.
* Clone the repo: ``git clone https://github.com/swt83/sublime-tabs2spaces.git tabs2spaces``.

That's it.  You're done.
